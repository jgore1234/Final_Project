                      From nose to finish, there's so much complexity to be found in this landmark German Pinot Blanc. It's dry and silken in texture, with delicate pear and yellow apple flavors anchored by veins of smoky, crystalline minerality and racy lime acidity. A subtle, steely wine in youth that will develop greater power and intensity with time. Best 2023–2030.                      Anna Lee C.

                      As the low alcohol would suggest, this leans heavily on its strong acidity. Fruit flavors are beyond tart, almost sour, with lemon drop tang and tension.

It would be a fine match for raw shellfish or grilled octopus, or served as an appetizer wine with salted nuts and cheeses.

                      Unless you are madly in love with high-acid wines, this is likely to seem simply sour.

                      This is all about understatement: there is a waft of oyster shell on the nose, nothing more. The palate, however, displays ample depth of stony, almost salty intensity. There is nothing obvious about this wine, just depth and concentration that will take time to come into their own. This needs bottle age and will come out nutty, poised and rounded.

                      A sonorous touch of vanilla lends its smoky aspect to the bright fruit of this intriguing Pinot Blanc. The palate, which is compact, streamlined and concentrated, revels in those smoky notes and will need time to unveil its gentle white-currant fruit. Lemony freshness preserves everything. This is one for the long run. Drink 2022–2030.

                      This slender but expressive Pinot Blanc is possessed of a wonderfully light touch. Right now, yeasty tones still swing alongside the bright stone fruit but this will soon come into its own and show off the slender but distinct and food friendly nature of Pinot Blanc. Revel in the subtle stony depth and elegance of this wine. Its long finish tells you everything.

                      The first vintage of this variety for this producer, this lovely white comes from a rare and renowned site in Green Valley. An austere nose of lemony green apple and honey follows through on the crisp, light-bodied palate. Floral in apple blossom, it reveals a touch of wet stone on the finish.

                      The nose is a very inviting and attractive mix of bright blossom honey and ripe lemon peel: the palate follows with rounded richness that is streamlined by lovely unobtrusive freshness. It's a generous but harmoniously balanced wine and certainly a very good take on the much underrated Pinot Blanc grape.

                      A smoky, almost meaty tone of hazelnut is the first impression on the nose. This smokiness carries over onto the lemon zest, which defines the palate. This is poised and streamlined and will stand its gentle but firm ground at the table.

                      At present, the full hit of generous oak holds sway over this wine, bathing everything in shades of warm vanilla. The palate responds to this with freshness and some concentration at the core. If you love the flavors of oak and generous roundedness, you will love this.
