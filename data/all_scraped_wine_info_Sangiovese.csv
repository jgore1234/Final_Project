                      This compelling 38-year-old—recently released from the estate—boasts layers of complexity, depth and energy.

                      This wine is Sangiovese (86%) and Malbec, with the fruit coming from Boushey and Gamache, respectively. The aromas offer notes of coffee, sautéed herb and chocolate. It's loaded with coffee and cherry flavors. Lightly grainy tannins back it up. It's delicious, but the oak (34% new French) seems to get in the way of the fruit at times.                      Sean P.

                      Sangiovese is not a common rosé style in California, yet this one shows that it works.

There's a pleasant brightness to the tart fruit flavors and firm tannins, backed by lively acidity. There's an Old World sensibility to it, and it will be best enjoyed at the dinner table.
