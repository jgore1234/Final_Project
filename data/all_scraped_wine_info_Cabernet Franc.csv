With small amounts of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Petit Verdot, it will do well in the cellar; enjoy best from 2025–2030.

The palate is medium in weight, but with a feathery quality to the fruit, raspy tannins and a powdery texture. At the close, it shows a lovely, long finish that tastes like Chinese Five spice. Layered, likable and full of personality, this makes for fun, youthful drinking now, but should age until 2030 at least.

                      A very beautiful shade of pink, this bottling is a bit funky throughout, starting with aromas of caked earth and cold metal. The palate shows a decent tension, yet the flavors of dried fruit and damp herbs aren't typical for a rosé.

                      The aromas are off, with volatile notes along with green pepper and game lurking in the background. The palate is light and elegant, showing a pleasant sense of the variety.                      Sean P.

                      Top of the range from this producer, this complex, dense wine is still packed with young, developing tannins. Two years in wood enhances the smoky character. The rich structure, black fruits and concentration all show this wine will age. Drink from 2022.

                      Sourced from a vineyard at the highest point of the appellation, close to the village of Dampierre, this is a serious, concentrated wine. It's dense, with layers of black cherry fruits, rich tannins and acidity. Wood-aged in massive 660-gallon barrels, it has a firm structure, which will allow it to age well. Drink from 2022.
