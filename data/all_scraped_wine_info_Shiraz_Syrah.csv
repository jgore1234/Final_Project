                      This extraordinary wine offers a tantalizing, bold, black-pepper aroma that leads to deep, just-ripe black-fruit flavors and an array of clove, espresso and earth accents that give it delicious complexity. It is tightly wrapped in fine-grained tannins at this point, but will bring out more complexity and smoothness with time. Best from 2026.

                      Notes of schist and iodine meld into sprays of violet and rose petal in this vibrant, perfumed Syrah. Matured for 15 to 28 months in large-format casks, it offers a rich core of raspberry-coulis and red-currant flavors struck by crisp acidity and very fine, mouthcoating tannins.

An aromatic lift of tangy blueberry, raspberry and plum fruit interlaces gentle baking spice, ground pepper and terra-cotta notes.

The palate shows more freshness and focus, with fruit purity and a lovely violet and baking spice note flowing to the finish.

                      This is a flat-out beautiful expression of valley Syrah. The aromas draw you into the glass, with notes of blueberry, plum and herb.

The balance throughout is captivating as is the exceptionally lengthy, flavorful finish, kicking it up a notch. Gorgeous stuff.

                      The average age of the vines for this premium Shiraz is 1936, but some date back to 1854. From French and American staves coopered on site, ""Octavius"" offers an evocative and multifaceted nose with everything from currants, licorice and mocha to cedar, bay leaf and cloves. There's a lovely woodsy, wintery vibe, and a touch of bottle age, too that softens the ripe fruit but highlights the oak. The palate is powerful and lean at the moment, with elevated acidity and taut, slightly woody tannins. There's a nice tang to the fruit. It's hard to predict how this will age but the hope is it's got another decade left in it at least.

                      This is, hence the name, a drink-now style with no added sulfites.

Fruity and ripe, it leads with fleshy red berries, damp leaves, violet and a slight meaty note. The fruit on the palate feels somewhat heavy and syrupy even while the texture is thin with plenty of acidity. Tannins are soft but astringent and don't quite jell.

                      Though this producer's standard Crozes-Hermitage Syrah is a winner, too, older vines and longer maturation in large-format oak lends a richness and complexity to intense black cherry and cassis here. It's a gorgeously perfumed wine peppered by hints of dried mushroom, fur and violet candy. The finish is very long and lingers on alternating inflections of granite and blossom.

                      This polished, cellar-worthy Shiraz is made in open-top concrete vats from old vines in the Barossa and Eden Valleys. It's a spicy specimen, some of which seems fruit-derived and some from the oak. There's a heady combo of cedary, woodsy spice, with plump red and black berries, tobacco leaf and fistfuls of other dried herbs and spices. The palate is tautly wound by fine tannins, and even amidst all the spice, the fruit holds its own, pure and juicy. Currently showing quite a bit of oak, this could use another few years in bottle or plenty of protein if drinking now. It should go until 2040 at least.

                      From the sunny South Aussie Coonawarra region, this is a Shiraz you could cut with a knife. It needs a decanter if drinking young but with air it quickly offers ripe berry fruit, menthol and oak spice. Powerful, chewy tannins envelop the plush, tangy fruit on the palate. Ideally, this needs more time for those tannins to settle into the wine. Drink 2022–2030.

                      This vintage is quite young and closed at the moment. After lots of swirling and time in glass it opens somewhat, revealing fresh black cherry, blueberry, licorice and sweet spices. The oak is prominent, and, as in previous years, a little on the soapy side. Things improve significantly on the palate, however, where a lift of refreshing acidity adds tang to the already fresh fruit. The tannins are fine and chalky, and a line of crushed Mediterranean herbs makes its way to the finish. Drink 2022–2035.

                      The 2017 was a hot vintage in the Hunter Valley and even though alcohol is restrained, the warmth of the season is still felt in this wine. The nose is initially reductive so decant if drinking now. With air, notes of ripe blueberry, cherry, plum, dried rose and peppery spice make their way out. The palate is powerful yet focused, with taut, spicy, somewhat austere tannins alongside heaps of acidity and chalky texture. There's a slight bitterness on the finish. This needs more time in bottle to relax its iron grip. Drink 2022–2035.

The oak is present but softly spoken. In the mouth, it shows a lovely tang of acidity and juicy fruit, but the tannins are on the lean and mean side, drying at the finish. Overall, this feels unforced and allowed to express both fruit and site. It's drinking well now but should keep until 2025.

                      Crumpled hibiscus, white-pepper, black-raspberry and dried lamb aromas show on this bottling from a vineyard that sits between the Chalone and Mt. Harlan appellations. The floral aspects pop first on the palate, then come richer waves of elderberry and mulberry, with pepper spice lasting long into the finish.

                      Slightly lighter in the glass than other Syrahs, this bottling is immensely savory, showing cracked pepper, crushed rocks, dried blackberry and black plum on a well-focused nose. It's very fresh on the palate, with snappy black raspberry and a dusting of white pepper, with warming hints of baking spice into the finish.

                      Crumpled lavender, tart black plum and a hint of teriyaki show on the nose of this bottling from the Tensley family's home vineyard. Savory flavors of roasted beef, crusted in rosemary and lavender, meet with cassis and are wrapped in firm tannins on the palate.

                      One of the annual magnum-only releases from Joey Tensley, this one, named after his niece, blends syrah from Rodney's and Colson Canyon vineyards with 25% Grenache from the latter as well. Rich black-plum, cola, smoked beef and pepper aromas hit all the right notes on the nose, while the palate offers hearty cassis and sarsaparilla spice. Drink 2022–2038.

                      Named for winemaker Joey Tensley's son, Oliver Gunnar Tensley, this magnum bottling combines from the Tensley, Colson Canyon and Thompson vineyards. The nose is intense with pepper, violets and açai aromas, leading into a palate that is deep and rich with cassis and cracked pepper, yet leveled by tons of acidity. Drink 2022–2040.

                      Smoky aromas of mesquite meet with smoked lamb shank and blackberry compote on the nose of this heavy-duty bottling. More smoked meats and rich cassis are lifted by cracked peppercorns and lush caramel on the palate, where the oak elements are powerful but delicious.
