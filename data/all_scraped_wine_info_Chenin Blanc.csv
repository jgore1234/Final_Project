                      Winemaker: Bruwer Raats. Fresh apple flesh, white peach, melon and creamed citrus form the fruity core of this attractive white, all hit with spicy top-notes of lightly toasted oak and woodspice. Medium in weight, the palate shows a roundness and creamy texture that complements the rich, ripe fruit flavors, but is lifted by vibrant acidity that keeps the mouthfeel fresh and the finish crisp. It's easy to like now, but this should continue to develop further depth and complexities well through 2028.

                      A fairly rich take on this grape, which many wineries use from this particular vineyard, this bottling is flush with white peach and white melon aromas, cut by lime and dried lemon blossoms, and layered with intriguing kiwi and exotic citrus notes. The palate is more simple, with apple and lemon flavors and chalky texture.

                      Accented by a light touch of honey, this attractive wine is fruity, with a nutty underlying texture and a rich body. Full and ripe, it could age until 2016 although it's quite ready to drink.

                      This is a ripe, full-bodied wine with already rounded texture and fresh pear flavors. It is perfumed, richly textured, the acidity a balanced part of the fruitiness of the wine. It needs to age, so drink from 2017.

                      This soft wine has fresh acidity that lifts the peppered pear flavors. It's ready to drink, very fruity while keeping its mineral and chalky texture. The aftertaste is ripe and also fresh.
