                      This is a new offering from the winery, with the grapes left on skins for 40 days. The color is almost apple cider-like in appearance but with a slightly more red, cloudy hue. The aromas bring notes of fresh raspberry, pink grapefruit and whole pomegranate. The flavors are bright and fresh, with a lot of texture and graininess in feel.

                      Eyrie was the first to plant Pinot Gris in America, long before it became Oregon's most famous white grape. No surprise that five decades later it's Eyrie that makes the state's most distinctive, elegant version of the grape. Beautifully textured mixed tree fruits—apple and white peach—are on display here, along with details of freshly baked bread and light herbs such as parsley. A touch of melon comes up in the back palate, and the wine just keeps chugging along through a marvelous finish.

                      The unusual moniker, Winemaker Bruno Corneaux explains, is the traditional Burgundian name for Pinot Gris. Fermented in neutral oak and left on the lees until bottling, this is a smooth, supple wine, with lovely flavors of cut pear and apple cobbler. The texture and lingering fruit flavors suggest drinking this while young, though it should age well through 2025.

                      Clever marketing and eye-catching labels aside, this Hawkes Bay Pinot Gris doesn't succeed in the deliciousness department as well at the label's Albariño does, but fans of rich, textural whites will dig it. It's a little candied and plastic at first and then offers more appealing apple and pear strudel notes with time in the glass. The palate is viscous with ripe, fleshy orchard fruit, and the acidity is enough to lift it out of syrupy territory.

It's highly perfumed yet delicate, like a summer breeze that carries scents of cherries and apricots still on the tree, wild strawberries in the fields, and stones along a nearby stream. Feathery light on the palate, the wild red berries are crunchy and fresh thanks to bright acidity. A spicy, cocktail bitters flavor adds a base note.
