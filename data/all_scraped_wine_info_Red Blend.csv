                      Seppeltsfield's Centennial wines have been released annually for past 140 years and are believed to be the only single-vintage wines with such unbroken lineage on the planet. While the full composition is unknown, this now 101-year-old wine is composed primarily of Shiraz and Grenache and fortified with grape spirit. Resembling molasses in both color and texture, it is deeply evocative—a bottomless well of aroma and flavor that goes on and on: first chocolate, dates and praline, then baking spice and coffee beans, then tree sap, forest floor and the dusty spine of an old book. Intensely concentrated yet extraordinarily fresh, it is like drinking the essence of the past, a time in Australia just after WWI when hope was in the air. This is an exceptionally rare beauty that will outlive all of us.

                      The longer Napa winemaker Chris Carpenter spends in McLaren Vale, the more in tune he seems to be with the country's palate and the region's unique terroirs. This is a precise and highly age worthy example of Oz's most famed red blend. Fleshy plum and blueberry fruit mingles with mint and other dried herbs, chocolate, bay leaf and peppery spice. The barrel influence is there too, but it's better integrated than in the past. At the moment the palate is a beast, with oodles of fruit and spice and muscular, chalky tannins, but there's chisel, finesse and a lengthy finish—all the trimmings of a harmonious wine set for the long haul.

More elegant, lucid and fruit driven than the '18, this may not age as long but it's drinking pretty darn well now. Notes of cherries, blueberries, licorice, violets and Chinese five spice are wound in sappy, savory tannins that have lovely texture and integration.

                      The Shiraz and Cab grapes for this organic wine are left to dry on the vine for two weeks, which isn't overly obvious since the wine is fresh fruited, even with some bottle age, and there's a lovely raw, stripped back feel to it. The nose is a fragrant combo of cherry cola, plums, potpourri, dried mint and ground pepper with a medicinal herbal back note. The palate is straightforward—medium to full bodied with gentle, well-integrated tannins and silky fruit—but there's an overall ease and charm about this wine that will make it the first to be drained at the dinner table.
