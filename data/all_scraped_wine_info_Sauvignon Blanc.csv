The nose billows high toned, slightly confected peach, melon and lemon-lime popsicle notes. There's a touch of grass and a feline pungency to remind us we're in Marlborough after all.

This is classic life-of-the-party Marlborough SB with all that's charming about the style minus all that's sweaty and feline. Passion fruit, grapefruit, lime and peach explode from the glass with softer grassier notes following in the wake. The palate is equally explosive, like a Popsicle on overdrive: fresh and fruity, with a gentleness to the texture to temper all that acidity. This is an affordable example of an iconic and inimitable wine style. Drink now.

                      In line with many in this category, there's a hefty funk factor here. It opens with pungent oniony, feline notes followed by green-bell-pepper, snow-pea and seashell aromas. Stone and citrus fruit peek through the cracks. The reductive, underripe elements are more prominent on the palate where what feels like a small amount of residual sugar adds a bit of texture and sweetness to the jagged edged acidity.
