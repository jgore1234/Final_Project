                      On the nose of this wine, subtle notions of barley sugar and candied orange peel promise richness. The palate comes with concentrated but restrained sweetness that settles like balm on the tongue.

The balance reflects a most original expression of Alsace. It's a wine to take time over. Drink by 2045.

Grapefruit, pineapple, ginger, honey, wet hay, spice and a slight funk (terroirs-derived, not winemaking) lead to a palate that is somewhat less bombastic. Evoking a warm spring day, honey and river stones are buttoned by a savory, earthy, skinsy grip at the finish.

                      This Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc blend from the most inland subregion of the Great Southern shows lots of varietal character from both grapes, particularly on the nose. Aromas of lemon, stone fruit, lanolin, snow pea and tomato leaf flow into a palate that wants for a bit more texture, maybe even some phenolics for added complexity. What's there is cheek-biting acidity amid chalky yet bouncy fruit. Give this another year or two in bottle to gain complexity.

Light to medium bodied, there's a slippery mouthfeel, buoyed by prickly acidity. A straightforward but balanced drop.
