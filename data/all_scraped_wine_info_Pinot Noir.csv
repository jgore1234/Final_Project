There's black cherry fruit at the center, and just-ripe tannins that leave a hint of tea. You may pick up a smoky scent that carries into the finish, and it should be remembered that there was smoke in some vineyards during this vintage. But barrels are smoky also, and all the components of this wine work synergistically. Drink now and over the next two or three years.

                      This small-batch label is from Paul and Gilli Lipscombe, who have been instrumental in putting Tasmania's Huon Valley on the map. A vibrant, translucent cherry hue, this is an ethereal Pinot that pulses with energy; smashable (as the Aussies say) and serious all at once. The nose is delicately aromatic, reeling you in gently. Notes of wild blueberry and strawberry, dried flowers and a whiff of baking spice and an olive grove at harvest float from the glass. The palate crackles with acidity, bouncy bright fruit and spice, and a cocktail bitters-like bite at the finish. A buzzy wine with heart and soul.

                      From Tasmania's east coast, this is a structured Pinot that needs air to blow off some funky, meaty reductive notes. When it does open, it offers a nose of blueberries and cherries, wintery spices and herbs, river stones and a streak of barrel influence. The palate is wound tightly by rather austere tannins, but there's a lovely purity of fruit and spice that makes this drinkable now with fatty protein, or capable of aging until 2030.

                      This Yarra Valley Pinot is aging quickly. A dusty brick hue, the nose shows some volatility, but there's also a good deal more: notes of cherry cordial, crushed dried rose petals—some on their stems—and soft cinnamon bark and clove spice. There's a good lick of oak, too, which is more prominent on the palate. Granular tannins, still-fresh acidity and cherry-and-rose characters dominate. The finish is a little bitter.

                      There's a lot of sweet, fruity oak on this Pinot for this reviewer's taste. It covers up the lovely berry fruit, vanilla and savory spice character of the site and grapes. A medium- to full-bodied sip, the fruit and oak sit heavily together in the mouth. That said, tannins are nicely structured and textured, hinting that this Pinot could hold up decently with time in the bottle. For now, though, it doesn't do Tassie's unique terroirs and elegant fruit justice.

But with vigorous swirling in the glass or time in a decanter this blows off, revealing a sappy, spicy wine with a good lick of toasty oak influence. There are notes of fresh red currant and cranberry, warm tar, graphite, sap and a medicinal herbal nuance. Tannins in the mouth are sappy and somewhat astringent and oak-driven, dominating a wine that needs at least another few years before optimal drinking time. Drink 2023–2028.

                      One of the most widely available Oregon Pinots, the Acrobat maintains its easy-drinking style while capturing the basic varietal character of the grape. Fruity berry flavors, moderate alcohol, balanced acidity and tamed tannins all bring this forward, pleasant wine into focus. Drink over the next half decade.

                      Scorched beef, singed sage, iron shavings and cranberry aromas make for a unique nose on this bottling. There's a rugged quality to the sip, where sun-dried earth and charred meat flavors sit atop the light strawberry and cranberry fruit.

                      Rosewater-extract, balsamic-cranberry-sauce and potpourri aromas show on the tangy, slightly funky nose of this bottling.

                      This is a thick, toasty and oak-driven red wine, with waxy red fruit at its heart.

                      There's not much depth here, just light cherry and cola flavors. A whiff of vanilla and hints of mocha add some detail, and the wine does a quick fade, finishing with slightly bitter tannins.

                      Plummy red berry aromas include notes of oak grain, paint and vanilla.

                      This wine seems to be at or slightly past its prime. Cherry cola fruit has a faded feeling, and the accents of leather and funk emphasize the sense that it should be consumed now. It finishes with a dash of lemon oil.

                      A pinched and gritty nose is shy on fruit aromas and requires airing to freshen up. A tight palate is limited in scope and breadth, while this tastes of plum, currant and tomato. On the finish, this leaves a mild burning sensation.
