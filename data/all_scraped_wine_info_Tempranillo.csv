                      Smoky, toasty black-fruit aromas are lightly charred but calm and stately. This has bounce to its step, but mostly the palate is dry, tannic and aggressive: an indication that this needs more time in bottle. Toasty blackberry flavors are backed by savory meatiness, while this shows chewy tannins on a warm finish with lots of depth. Best from 2023–2032.

                      From the cool climes and interesting soils of Beechworth in Victoria, this is a high-toned, lucid Tempranillo with a hearty dose of varietal charm. It weaves strawberry and cherry fruit with cedar, cigar box, baking spice and a meaty undertone. It's medium weight, with a supple, well-placed tannins and sappy, savory nuances which add complexity to the bouncy berry fruit.

                      This is a charming Tempranillo from one of McLaren's Vale's consistently top-notch small producers. There's lovely purity of fruit—like fresh blueberries, cherries and plums—which mingle with aromas of cocoa nibs, cloves, violets and roses. On the medium-weight palate, an initial burst of juicy fruit is balanced by lithe tannins. Neatly composed, this avoids the flabbiness of many New World Tempranillo and instead offered bundles of charm and class.

                      Smoked beef in a cherry-compote sauce, minty herbs, loamy soils and wet slate are all aromas that present themselves on the compelling nose of this bottling, which spent 36 months in barrel. The palate is smoky in flavor, with black-cherry and purple-flower touches and stiff tannins that carry into the savory finish. Drink 2020–2030.

                      Earthy berry, plum and spice aromas are smoky, toasty and integrated on the nose. This feels full and saturated on the palate, with smooth but present tannins. A jammy flavor profile includes blackberry and other black fruits, while a vanilla note accents the concentrated berry flavors on the finish. This has the stuffing and structure to age a long time; best 2024–2035.

                      Welcoming aromas of cola, oak and earthy plum are a touch tarry and fiery. On the palate, this shows moderate to good depth but still seems a bit narrow. Flavors of leafy, earthy berry and plum are lightly oaked and finish with spice notes attached to lingering berry and plum fruit. Drink through 2035.

                      Savory oak and spicy foresty berry aromas are a touch gritty. A grabby palate with controlled astringency tastes of salty, lightly stalky plum and raspberry, along with vanilla. Earthy berry and oak flavors dominate a finish with tannic rub. Drink through 2035.

                      Black-plum and cassis aromas include an exotic spice note akin to cardamom. In the mouth, this is smacking and dense. Baked black-fruit flavors include notes of black coffee, cocoa and burnt toast. On the finish, this stays chocolaty in flavor and comfortable in feel. Drink through 2026.

                      Slightly desiccated aromas of prune soften toasty dark-fruit scents. This Reserva from a warm vintage is tight and braced by red-fruit acidity. Plum and raspberry flavors are spicy like a fine Rioja should be, while this finishes with integration and a firm texture. Drink through 2025.

                      Rich aromas of black cherry, charcoal, olive and cola make for a compelling nose on this young Tempranillo. The palate combines deep and dark blackberry and black-plum flavors with charred beef, iodine and more black olive.

                      Jammy blueberry and cassis aromas set up a fleshy flush palate that qualifies as jammy. This tastes of blackberry, plum, vanilla and coconut. On the finish, ripe fruit flavors are compact, forward and stowing energy to spare. Drink through 2040.

                      Tar, smoky plum and berry aromas are fine but light on complexity and elegance. This feels tight, with edgy tannins, while roasted plum flavors finish short on depth. For a high-end Reserva from a great vintage, this is just good enough to recommend.
