                      This new brand is making a wide array of wines, and hit on a surprise winner with this single-vineyard Malbec from atop the Cuesta Grade. Dark black-fruit and cocoa aromas are complemented by mushroom and forest-floor scents on the nose. The palate is rich in umami tones, full of black cherry, dried herbs and milk chocolate flavors atop a smooth and creamy tannic profile.

                      A straight Malbec in New Zealand is a fairly rare sighting, and even rarer is one with some bottle age. This wine is in a good place. The oak-driven mocha-and-toasted spice is a little prominent, but the fresh red and black berry fruit, mint and tobacco leaf characters hold their own. In the mouth, tannins are chalky and chunky, but there's a lovely crunch of acidity, and once again the tangy fruit is not lost. There's some flash and muscle here, but there's also plenty of cool climate charm. Drink now with protein and decanter at hand or until 2030.

This highly approachable Malbec weaves fresh cherries, cranberries and raspberries together with notes of fresh mint, tree sap and tobacco leaf. The palate is as fresh as the nose suggests, with lithe, granular tannins and crunchy fruit. Drink slightly chilled with a weeknight roast or platter of cured meats.

                      This is in an odd place at the moment, but if the 2017 is anything to by, it will hopefully find its way with another year in the bottle. There's a burnt rubber note on the nose, but there's also plenty of more appealing aromas like fresh mint, red and black berries, earthy spices and a dusty oak character. The palate is equally austere. Tannins are big and chewy, lacking a generosity of fruit to temper them. Give this at least a year to unravel. Drink 2022–2028.

                      Varietal Malbec is a rarity in the valley. This one is single block, native fermented and saw only 20% new oak. The aromas take some time to get going, but once they do, they bring notes of purple flower, blue fruit and crushed rock. Lipsmacking fruit flavors follow, showing intensity and vibrancy as well as exquisite balance and length. It's shockingly good, a new style of higher altitude Malbec for Washington with all the goodness that brings. Decant if drinking in the near term. Best after 2024.                      Sean P.

                      Given that 2015 was a tough year in Mendoza, especially for high-expression reds like this, Apartado is an unbridled success. This is round, ripe and complex on the nose, with exotic aromas of cardamom, spiced blueberry and rubber. The palate feels bold, crisp and bright. Flavors of blackberry, boysenberry and mixed spices drop off little by little on the finish. Drink for years to come; cellar through 2035.

                      Even in the most challenging vintages (2015), Cobos always produces at least one stellar wine, and this is it. A pitch-black color and ripe extracted aromas of dried cheese, prune, blackberry and char lead to a huge palate with soft tannins and bold acidity. Charred blackberry, coffee and grilled steak flavors end in darkness on the finish. Drink through 2028.
