                      This zippy, laser-edged auslese offsets luminous tangerine, white peach and honeydew flavors against an electric jolt of lime and lemon acidity.

Buoyant fruit and heady perfume makes it irresistible young but it will continue to improve for decades.                      Anna Lee C.

                      The Herrenberg vineyard historically played second fiddle to the estate's more famed Abtsberg, but with shifting climactic conditions, GG wines from this vineyard are showing an intensity of fruit and mineral vitality that rivals its sibling bottlings. While slim in profile, this is a penetrating, reverberating sip packed with scintillating tangerine, yellow peach and nectarine flavors.

                      This is a tasty vintage of a classic Great Southern Riesling. Lifted, delicate aromas of fresh lemon-lime, lavender and talcum powder with a whiff of honey lead to a long, harmonious palate. A crunch of acidity makes the citrus fruit feel tingly. Ginger spice and textural layers add complexity. Bone-dry, this would make an excellent pairing with spicy Southeast Asian cuisine.

                      Glorious whiffs of petrichor and pristine white peach abound on this deeply concentrated library release. Full-bodied and still fresh in demeanor, it offers a lovely combination of bright peach and lemon flavors against delicate maturity notes of earth, smoke and brine. A tug of tannins extends the finish along with a piercing strike of acidity. Lovely now but should continue to gain interesting subtleties through the decade.                      Anna Lee C.
