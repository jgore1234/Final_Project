It's a massive, almost corpulent, wine aged nine months in used French oak but also has a core of glimmering apricot and honeydew flavors. The finish is long and waxy, lingering on a kiss of smoke and vanilla. A decadent wine, it's ready now but should develop more earthen subtleties through 2028.                      Anna Lee C.

                      This is the inaugural vintage of this wine, coming from high up on Red Mountain. Aromas of pear, peach, lees and mineral are followed by textured fruit flavors that show a strong sense of vibrancy and, dare I say, minerality. The intensity, balance and length are impressive. It focuses on lees expression and texture rather than sheer varietal purity.                      Sean P.

                      Yalumba's—and Australia's—best known Viognier is a medium-bodied, food-friendly number, if currently a bit jangly. The nose is bright and appealing with notes of lime blossom, ground ginger, and apple and peach still on the tree. The palate carries these flavors through to the finish, but the acidity and oak never quite knit together, nor is the texture interesting enough to get past it. Nevertheless, Viognier fans should enjoy the honeyed complexity this will gain with time. Drink 2022–2028.

                      Viognier can go in many different directions, from bitter and botanical to fruity and syrupy, but rarely is it perfectly on point, as it is here. Ripe lemon and tangerine, along with highlights of grapefruit and nectarine, combine in a refreshing, mouthfilling wine with a creamy minerality adding texture throughout. Fermented in neutral French oak, it's a versatile and delicious wine perfectly suited to the site.
