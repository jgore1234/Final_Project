Bone-dry and creamy textured yet fresh, there's a slight phenolic bite at the finish.

                      Both the heady honeysuckle and Amalfi lemon notes on the nose seem to benefit from still being tinged with flinty reduction. The palate is intense and comes in with concentrated lemon zestiness that tingles across the taste buds. A smoky stoniness provides a solid and bold backdrop for hints of peach and more florals. This seems to have elixir-like power and prowess. Its central vein of smoky lemon zest makes you go back for more. This needs bottle age but promises to be sensational.
