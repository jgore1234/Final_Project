                      This is a full-throttle orange wine from one of the country's top biodynamic producers. Pinot Gris plus a bit of Muscat and Gew√ºrztraminer is left on skins for 40 days. The result is a marmalade-hued wine that jumps from the glass with heady notes of orange peel, cinnamon, cloves and Campari-like bitters.

                      Bottled in the type of massive, deeply punted glass generally reserved for pricey reserve Cabernets, this seems to promise something special. Fermentation and aging in French oak puncheons has helped to smooth out the rough edges and high acids, without impacting flavors.

                      Pinot Gris on skins, so technically this is a skin-contact white, although it looks and tastes like a ros√©. Don't let the cloudy appearance deter you. It's highly perfumed yet delicate, like a summer breeze that carries scents of cherries and apricots still on the tree, wild strawberries in the fields, and stones along a nearby stream. Feathery light on the palate, the wild red berries are crunchy and fresh thanks to bright acidity. A spicy, cocktail bitters flavor adds a base note. Drink chilled to kick off an evening of merriment.

                      This delicious ros√© is all Pinot Gris, fermented and aged in a mix of amphorae, concrete egg and neutral oak. Whether you consider it an unusually dark white wine, a ros√© or an orange wine, it is undeniably delicious. A bright copper color, it's packed with bold flavors of orange and pear liqueur. Slightly oxidized and already a year older than most ros√©s, it will reward near-term drinking with floral-citrus aromas, lushly ripened fruit and a finishing hint of toast.

                      An earthy rounded ripeness hovers on the nose of this wine that is dominated by ripe pear. Hints of pear peel adds pithiness. The palate expresses the pear fruit fully and adds a pleasantly bitter edge of almond. This is concentrated, structured and juicy through the off-dry finish.

                      A touch of reduction lends an earthy note to the nose of this wine but underneath fresh, ripe pear becomes apparent. The palate brings out the full force of the juicy fruit. It has alcoholic warmth, a pleasantly bitter phenolic backbone and real concentration. Even the extended finish is juicy with pear.

                      A sense of rounded earthiness surrounds notes of dried and fresh pear on the nose of this wine, which also has a hint of sultana. An off-dry palate boosts the ripe pear notes that come with a phenolic texture akin to pear peel. The finish is fruity, intense and long with a moreish saltiness.

                      A mellow hint of ripe pear melds with a fresher edge of green apple in this wine. The palate plays a similar game of pitting rich, sweet pear agains freshness, helped along by a pleasant phenolic bitterness that holds traces of almond and licorice. The concentrated finish is off dry, and a little warm, but also long.

                      Mellow notes of fresh and baked yellow apple characterize the nose of this wine. On the medium-sweet palate they are joined by notions of gingerbread spice and framed by phenolic notes of bitter almond. This is a rich, layered, rounded wine with an intense and mouthwatering finish.

                      A spirity lift rises from the glass first, followed by notions of pear.

                      Fragrant touches of ripe russet-pear peel have an enticing lemon lift on the nose of this wine. The palate delivers these same hints and the lemony freshness gives focus and expression to those pure notes of ripe pear. This fruitiness is countered with concentration and warmth, while the finish is dry and long.

                      A shy nose hints at pear but does not want to give away more. On the palate this wine is medium sweet but edged with pithy, textured phenolics that gives structure and firmness, supporting the gentle freshness.

                      Almost overripe pear on the nose of this wine has earthy roundness. The rich, sweet palate envelopes everything in residual sugar, taking this well beyond off dry. An edge of zesty freshness counters the generosity and lends tone on the finish.
