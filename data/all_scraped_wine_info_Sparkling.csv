                      Disgorged in April 2020, this piercing traditional-method sekt spent roughly five years on its lees developing seductive, smoky nuances of brioche and toast.

                      A crushed yarrow aroma on the fresh nose marks this out as an unusual sparkler. The palate comes in with rounded, ripe fruit that makes the streamlined freshness and purity at its core even more apparent. A hint of freshly cut red apple plays on the creamy midpalate, where fine foam is lively. A really elegant Sekt that is delicious now but will evolve with further bottle age. The bone-dry finish is a triumph.

                      The wine's nose unites pervasive freshness with mellow richness in its insistent green and tart red apple notions. Those same, opposing poles of utterly tart, bright freshness and creamy, mellow ripeness also combine on the palate, making this a most exciting proposition. Neither pole takes over, keeping that lovely tension all the way to the dry finish.

In this rich but bone-dry wine, the mellowness of oak is central. Fresh yet evolved, this is a complex sparkler for the table rather than aperitif.

The mousse is admirably fine, and the finish is dry.
