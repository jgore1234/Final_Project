                      The strongest offering of this producer's “alternative” red varieties, this northern Italian variety—not often seen Down Under—has some bottle age but still feels fresh as a daisy. The color of a black cherry and rose petal infusion, it's very fruity and perfumed, like strawberry, cherry and blueberry juice speckled with flower petals and wood spice. The palate is medium bodied and silky with a lovely grip of sappy tannins to balance the plump fruit. A pleasure-inducing drop to drink now slightly chilled.

Unoaked, this rarely seen Down Under Italian variety is allowed to shine. It's brambly, spicy and chocolaty. Think Morello cherries, ground pepper, bay leaf, dried mint and cocoa bean. It's medium to full bodied with soaring acidity and wonderfully raspy tannins. There's a rustic Italian vino di tavola vibe going on here that cries out for a pizza pie or a heaping bowl of Bolognese.

                      Sourced from the warm climes of Langhorne Creek, this Italian varietal is radiant purple in color. Its 100% whole bunch fermentation has resulted in an intensely spicy, medicinal nose that bursts with licorice root, cherry cordial, violets and cocktail bitters. Medium in body, the mouthfeel is juicy and silky—and less overtly medicinal than the nose—wound by fine, chalky tannins. There's no oak here, so fruit purity is retained. This is a style that will be divisive. For this reviewer, it's a joyful, quirky drop.

                      Ashley and Holly Ratcliff have been almost single-handedly responsible for reviving the hot South Aussie Riverland region, once a major supplier of bulk fruit to large wine companies. Through the planting of organically farmed, heat tolerant Mediterranean varieties, their quality fruit goes into the wines of many of Australia's young gun winemakers, and also into their own wines, Ricca Terra. The Nero is a deep well of cherries and blackberries, underpinned by dried herbal, graphite and hot tar notes. The palate neatly balances silky, juicy fruit and herbs with savory tannins and lifted acidity. An approachable medium- to full-bodied wine to sip with wintery fare.
