                      This is a seriously hearty Merlot, starting with aromas of dark plum, mulberry, tea leaf, oregano and baked soil. There's an intriguing array of dried garden herbs on the palate, which gives an elegant spin to the richer blackberry-jam backdrop. Dry, fine tannins lead to a cocoa finish.

                      At first the strong flavors of vanilla bean and Bourbon tobacco overtake the lighter sour cherry fruit component. Merlot can be a difficult grape to pin down, but this quickly moves past that challenge by pushing the barrel flavors forward and then bringing up the fruit. It's drinking well now, and with ample aeration it's quite flavorful, so best consumed over the next two or three years.

The flavors bring depth, plushness and intensity, with lightly chalky tannins backing it all up. It's flat-out delicious, with the appeal as much about feel as flavor.

This is a little hot on the nose, and sharp and tangy on the palate; notes of black cherry struggle to make themselves known before powdery, spicy tannins pummel and numb the palate.

Cedar, dried herb and clove surround dense black currant, licorice and brambly blackberry, with sinewy tannin and toasted oak in abundance.

                      Fruit from Quintessence Vineyard on Red Mountain makes up 86% of this wine, with the rest coming from the considerably cooler Red Willow in Yakima Valley. With this 100% varietal, the aromas start out brooding, with notes of Red Vines candy, dark raspberry, herb and dark chocolate. Bright, vibrant, palate-coating, textured red fruit and barrel flavors follow. It shows a lovely sense of depth and intensity but still freshness, with a lingering finish capping it off.

                      Though always Merlot dominant (and 84% in this vintage), this wine has not carried a varietal label in some time. A blend of Quintessence, Red Willow, Ciel du Cheval and Phinny Hill fruit, with brooding raspberry, coffee bean, cigar box, crème de cassis and herb notes out front. The palate mixes fruit and barrel, showing a lovely sense of deftness to the creamy-feeling flavors. Firm structure backs it all up, with café au lait notes lingering on the finish.

                      This Merlot feels a little synthetic and bitter. Though it leads with primary red fruits like cherries and strawberries, along with potpourri and chocolatey oak-derived notes, the palate is flabby and on the sour side. Spiced wood nuances add structure and the finish is herbal.

                      This Clare Valley Merlot starts somewhat reductively, the red and black berries and vanillin oak notes all a little masked. The palate feels a bit watery but is sweet fruited with gentle granular tannins. A synthetic quality creeps in, lingering to the finish, which feels a little bitter.
