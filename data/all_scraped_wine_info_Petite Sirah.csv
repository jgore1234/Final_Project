The color is black with a dark red rim, and the mouthfeel is broad and nicely astringent due to a high level of fine-grained tannnins. It's very full-bodied, too.

                      There's a great historic ghost story behind this bottling, as well as a creative twist to the cork closure, but the wine itself isn't as exciting. It's reserved on the nose, with hints of black cherry, vanilla and cola that prove easy to quaff. It is a bit simple on the sip, with dark red fruit and a slight sweetness.

                      For fans of the variety, this is a consistently blockbuster wine, well made and remarkably fruity and floral. Violet aromas ride quietly over rounded flavors of cherry pie as the body takes on full-figured dimension. Richly voluptuous, there's balance here within the firm robust tannin structure and heady licorice-laden end.

It incorporates small additions of Zinfandel and Carignane into the whole, a picture of soft beguiling violet aromas that are followed by a velvety texture and underlying grip of tannin.
